            The Phish and Tips project developed an interactive training site to help older people to become more confident in identifying phishing emails.  The training site is a safe environment to look at a number of example emails and decide whether they are suspicious or not.

            This video gives an overview of the training site. It is a screen recording that goes through what you see on the site and what a person needs to do when using the site. It contains descriptive captions and sound.

            We anticipate that the training site can be used by a person in different ways. Firstly, it can be used by a person at home on their own. Secondly, it can be used in a workshop or group environment where a people try it out with the help of a technical support facilitator in an organisation session, for example hosted by a charitable organisation.
  
            Our training site has been developed to work entirely within a browser, you do not need to download anything to get it to run. No personal data is collected through its use.  An organisation can download the training and include it  within their website if they wish to do so.

            This project was led by the University of Surrey and was funded by the National Centre for Cyber Security through one of its Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Education projects.
            
            The project engaged with stakeholders from several charity organisations including Surrey Coalition for Disabled People, Action for Elders and Age UK Surrey. The project team are grateful for their support during the project.
  
            We held several feedback sessions and focus groups to seek feedback on the Phish and Tips training site because we released it. We are grateful to all those participants who provided feedback on the look and feel of the site and for their feedback on what they learnt about phisihing emails after trying out the platform.
