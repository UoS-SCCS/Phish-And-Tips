                                                <p>The aim of the training was to encourage you to look at emails as a
                                                    series of smaller parts and to evaluate each one separately. You may
                                                    have seen examples of content we have labelled as suspicious in
                                                    legitimate emails. This is to be expected to some degree.</p>
                                                <p>Phishers and scammers look to replicate legitimate emails. A
                                                    legitimate company may send you an email with an urgent message,
                                                    whilst a
                                                    phisher will use urgent language to try to drive you towards their
                                                    scam website. This is one of the biggest challenges when evaluating
                                                    phishing emails.</p>
                                                <p>As such, the objective is not to classify the email as a whole, but
                                                    to encourage better risk evaluation. If you see one or more
                                                    suspicious parts to an email it does not necessarily mean the email
                                                    is a scam or phishing email, but it should encourage greater caution
                                                    and investigation on your part. If you are uncertain about whether
                                                    an email is legitimate do not hesitate to check with the company
                                                    directly or ask friends or relatives for their opinion.</p>

                                                <p>When
                                                    checking with a company make sure to use known good contact details,
                                                    for example, visit the website using a previously saved bookmark or
                                                    contact via a phone number from a previous bill, statement or
                                                    correspondence. In particular, do not use the contact details, links
                                                    or web addresses in the suspicious email itself as these may be part
                                                    of the scam. </p>

                                                    action you would not normally take, for example, visiting a
                                                    different website or providing your log in details. They do this by
                                                    creating a sense of urgency through techniques like threatening a

                                                    excluded from legitimate emails. Unfortunately many legitimate
                                                    companies are seeking to get you to take action as well, for
                                                    example, visiting their site, buying a product from them, or signing
                                                    up for new services. This can be one of the most difficult to
                                                    distinguish, but in general, if you feel a sense of urgency take a
                                                    moment to evaluate in more detail the email and if there are any
                                                    doubts, contact the company directly to determine if the email is

                                                <p>Do not be concerned about contacting a company directly to check. You
                                                    are not wasting their time. If they are sending emails out that are
                                                    difficult to distinguish from phishing and scam emails then that is
                                                    their own fault and they should be doing better.</p>

                                                    different to what is written in the text. Always check this value to
