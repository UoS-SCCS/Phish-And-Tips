This page contains links to download the learning materials and the training site. Users should use the copy of the training site hosted on this website, which is our recommended approach. However, if you wish to host the training site yourself, or serve it offline or locally, there are links to download it and access the source code provided.

## How to run the training site locally
To run the training site you need to first download the training site (see above). Unzip the file in any folder on your PC. We suggest that you put it in the documents folder.

Locate the index.html file in the downloaded folder, click the right mouse button on the file, look for the “Open With” in the menu options and choose the Chrome browser.

If you are using Firefox or Safari on your machine or an iPad you will need to use the online version from this website since these browsers do not support some of the interactive features of the website when it is run locally in a directory.
